The Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS) is a software solution designed to facilitate the management of clinical trials within the healthcare industry. It serves as a comprehensive platform for researchers, administrators, and other
stakeholders involved in the trial process.

Utilizing Windows Forms and C# as the primary tools, the CTMS offers a user-friendly interface for desktop applications, making it accessible to users within healthcare settings. The use of Windows Forms allows for efficient data input and visualization, enhancing the overall user experience.

In terms of database management, the CTMS employs a Code First approach with Entity Framework. This approach allows developers to define the domain model using C# classes, with the database schema generated automatically based on these classes. By adopting the Code First approach, the CTMS ensures flexibility and ease of maintenance, enabling developers to make changes to the database schema as needed without impacting the application's functionality.

Key features of the CTMS include patient enrollment and management, study protocol tracking, scheduling of visits and procedures, data collection and analysis, regulatory compliance monitoring, and reporting functionalities. These features are designed to streamline trial operations, improve efficiency, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
